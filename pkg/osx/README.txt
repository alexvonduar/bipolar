This disk image contains:

1. The Bipolar application.
2. A hook for capturing data from Polar FlowSync.

The Bipolar application can be run from here, or if preferred, dragged to your
Applications folder (or anywhere you like really), and run from there.

The hook is optional, but for Bipolar to be of any use, you will need either
the hook, or the direct V800 downloader (available from
https://github.com/profanum429/v800_downloader), or both.

If you choose to use the hook, you should first install Polar FlowSync (if you
haven't already), then go into the Hook directory within this disk image, and
run the install.command script.

See https://github.com/pcolby/bipolar and / or
https://github.com/profanum429/v800_downloader for more information.
